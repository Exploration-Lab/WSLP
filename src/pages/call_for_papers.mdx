# 📢 Call for Papers — IJCNLP-AACL 2025

## 👐 Workshop on Sign Language Processing

- 📍 **Location**: Victor Menezes Convention Centre, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India  
- 📅 **Date**: December 23, 2025  
- 🤝 **Held in conjunction with**: The 14th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP) and the 4th Asia-Pacific Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (AACL)

## 🌐 Overview

We invite submissions to the **Workshop on Sign Language Processing**, held at IJCNLP-AACL 2025. This one-day event brings together researchers and practitioners working on technologies for translating sign languages, with a focus on **low-resource and underrepresented contexts**.

While datasets like PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily have driven progress in sign language translation (SLT), many sign languages remain underrepresented due to limited annotated data. This workshop aims to support and showcase research across **all sign languages**, fostering inclusive, multilingual, and culturally aware SLT technologies.

### 🔍 Topics of Interest

We welcome submissions on topics including, but not limited to:

- Sign Language Translation for low-resource and underrepresented languages
- Continuous and gloss-free SLT methods
- Multilingual, cross-modal, and zero-shot SLT
- Knowledge transfer across sign languages or modalities
- Cultural and dialectal variation in sign language modeling
- Context-aware sign translation models
- Sign language corpus creation and annotation practices
- Fairness, bias, and ethical considerations in SLT
- Applications supporting Deaf communities in low-resource settings

## 📝 Submission Details

Submissions are managed through the **ACL Rolling Review (ARR)** system and **OpenReview**. We welcome:

- **Long papers** (up to 8 pages + references)
- **Short papers** (up to 4 pages + references)

All submissions must follow the [ACL 2025 formatting guidelines](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html) and use the [ACL template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computational-linguistics-acl-conference/jvxskxpnznfj). Submissions are peer-reviewed under **double-blind conditions**. Accepted papers will be published in the official **IJCNLP-AACL 2025 proceedings** in the ACL Anthology.



### 📄 Submission Types

- **Archival papers**: Long papers (up to 8 pages + references) or short papers (up to 4 pages + references) reporting completed, original, and unpublished research. An optional appendix may be included after the references in the same PDF. Accepted papers will be presented (posters or oral, determined by the program committee) and published in the proceedings. These undergo **double-blind peer review** and must be fully anonymized.
- **Non-archival extended abstracts**: Up to 2 pages + references, reporting work in progress or cross-submissions already published (or scheduled for publication) elsewhere. These are **non-archival** and will not appear in the proceedings. They are not subject to double-blind review and need not be anonymized. Accepted abstracts will be presented, primarily as posters.

### 🔄 Dual Submissions and Preprints

Dual submissions are allowed for the archival track, but authors must comply with the dual submission policies of the other venue. Papers posted to preprint servers (e.g., arXiv) can be submitted without restrictions on posting date.

### 📸 Camera-Ready Information

Authors of accepted archival papers must upload the final version by the camera-ready deadline. Authors may use **one extra page** to address reviewer comments (9 pages for long papers, 5 pages for short papers, plus references). Broader Impacts/Ethics and Limitations sections are optional and can be included on an additional 10th page for long papers or 6th page for short papers.
